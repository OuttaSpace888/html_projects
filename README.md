# HTML Code

Thank you for looking over my code! 
This is everything I got so far but I am experiencing some issues.

1. I want to get rid of the '>>' on top left corner of the Google Search page which I named g.search.html
    - I didn't add them there they just appeard for some reason but only for the 'Advanced' and 'Images' links.
2. On the Google Images page (image.s.html) I used the exact same code for the formatting as for the Google Search page
   but for some odd reason I can't put the 'Search' link to the top-right corner of the page.
    - I would like the Search link to be at the same location as the 'Advanced' and 'Images' links on the first Google Search page (g.search.html)
    - I am using the exact same formatting for both pages (google.css)
    - I am guessing that the issue is the picutre because when I remove the picture the 'Search' link appears on the top-right
      but whenever I insert the picture it moves down to this odd place. Can't picure of what's wrong with the picture especially 
      because I didn't have the same issue with my Google Search page. 
    - I will attach both pictures as well
